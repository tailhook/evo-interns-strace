<poem>
<line> When forty winters shall beseige thy brow, </line>
<line> And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field, </line>
<line> Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now, </line>
<line> Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held: </line>
<line> Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies, </line>
<line> Where all the treasure of thy lusty days, </line>
<line> To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes, </line>
<line> Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise. </line>
<line> How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use, </line>
<line> If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine </line>
<line> Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,' </line>
<line> Proving his beauty by succession thine! </line>
<line> This were to be new made when thou art old, </line>
<line> And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold. </line>
</poem>
