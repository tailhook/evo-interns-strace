<poem>
<line> Those hours, that with gentle work did frame </line>
<line> The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell, </line>
<line> Will play the tyrants to the very same </line>
<line> And that unfair which fairly doth excel: </line>
<line> For never-resting time leads summer on </line>
<line> To hideous winter and confounds him there; </line>
<line> Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, </line>
<line> Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where: </line>
<line> Then, were not summer's distillation left, </line>
<line> A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, </line>
<line> Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft, </line>
<line> Nor it nor no remembrance what it was: </line>
<line> But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet, </line>
<line> Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet. </line>
</poem>
