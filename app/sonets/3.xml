<poem>
<line> Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest </line>
<line> Now is the time that face should form another; </line>
<line> Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest, </line>
<line> Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother. </line>
<line> For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb </line>
<line> Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry? </line>
<line> Or who is he so fond will be the tomb </line>
<line> Of his self-love, to stop posterity? </line>
<line> Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee </line>
<line> Calls back the lovely April of her prime: </line>
<line> So thou through windows of thine age shall see </line>
<line> Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time. </line>
<line> But if thou live, remember'd not to be, </line>
<line> Die single, and thine image dies with thee. </line>
</poem>
