<poem>
<line> FROM fairest creatures we desire increase, </line>
<line> That thereby beauty's rose might never die, </line>
<line> But as the riper should by time decease, </line>
<line> His tender heir might bear his memory: </line>
<line> But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes, </line>
<line> Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel, </line>
<line> Making a famine where abundance lies, </line>
<line> Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel. </line>
<line> Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament </line>
<line> And only herald to the gaudy spring, </line>
<line> Within thine own bud buriest thy content </line>
<line> And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding. </line>
<line> Pity the world, or else this glutton be, </line>
<line> To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee. </line>
</poem>
